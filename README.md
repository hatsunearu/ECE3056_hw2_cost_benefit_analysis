# ECE3056_hw2_cost_benefit_analysis
crappy script to run my ECE 3056 homework and do cost benefit analysis. the homework was about computing energy vs. quality tradeoff of processing an image. i was given a picture in the form of 256x256 DCT values, and i had to discard some amount of higher frequency components. truncating higher frequency elements means less quality at the cost of using less energy. we assume that the processing stage was O(n^(3)). the homework assignment itself was a script that truncates an array and prints out how much simulated energy we used, given the amount of high frequency components discarded. this script adds upon that functionality by looping from no removed high frequency components to all components removed, and does automated cost-benefit analysis. no spreadsheets required.
